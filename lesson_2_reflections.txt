What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a directory called ".git" in which it will save all the commits and versions of my code.
I need to initialize a repository to allow Git keep track of whatever I'm doing.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

In the staging allows me to have more control of what changes to be commited.
